# Deep Audio Classification of Acoustic Recordings to Identify Elephant Distress Calls

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify audio recordings and identify distress calls from elephants. The goal is to support wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts by enabling automated detection of distress signals in acoustic data.

## Features
- Preprocessing of raw audio data
- Feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms)
- Deep neural network model for classification
- Evaluation metrics and performance visualization

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Librosa
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare the dataset in the required format.
3. Run the training script.
4. Evaluate the model on test samples.
